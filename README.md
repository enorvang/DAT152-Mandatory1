This exercise consists of two parts. In part one we will create a user interface for viewing tasks. In part two we will use Ajax to retrieve, store and update a database with tasks stored on the server. Your solution to part one should be used in part two to display the tasks stored on the server.

Note: this repository does not contain the supplied server code.
